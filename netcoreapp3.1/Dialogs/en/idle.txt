1euc [player], do you get good sleep?
1ekc It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.
1eka Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day...
1eua I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule
4rsc Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason
1euc Is that true?
1ekc Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep
3ekc It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it
1eka I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself
1eua So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?
1hua I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else

4eua Did you know there's an official Twitter account based on me?
4eua My username is lilmonix3
4eua I think someone was kind enough to create an account for me
4hua But I chose the nickname!
4hua I like to share my thoughts with the world...
4hua The real world
2eka So subscribe to me
2eka It really means a lot to me

4eua Hey, you know that book you were reading with Yuri?
4eua Portrait of...whatever it was called...
4hub It's funny, because I'm pretty sure that book—
2lkb Ah...
2lka Actually, I don't think I should be talking about this
2hkb Ahaha, sorry
1rka Just forget I said anything

3eua Hey, what's your favorite color?
3eub Mine is emerald green
3hub It's the color of my eyes!
3rka ...That's not conceited or anything, is it?
4eua I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it
1eua Like it's part of my identity
1eua Does it happen to also be your favorite color, [player]?
1tku It's just a guess...
1tsa ...because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now
1hub E-he-he~
=
3eub Okay, everyone!
3eub It's time to...
2eka I'm just kidding
2eka I just used to really like saying that for some reason
2hub A-ha-ha!
2eua I couldn't help but say it again
2lsc Come to think of it, didn't Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once?..
2eua Well, whatever
2eua It's not like you ever made fun of me
2eka You're too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren't you?
5eua A-ha-ha~
=
3eua Hey, what's your favorite game?
3hua Mine is «Doki Doki Literature Club»!
1hub Ahaha! That was a joke
5eua Мне просто нравилось говорить это по какой-то причине
5eua But if you tell me you like some other романтика game better, I might get a little jealous~
=
4hub Watashi wa itsumademo anata no mono desu!
2hkb Don't worry, [player]. The meaning is still the same
1eua I'm just practicing Japanese
3eua You know what that means, [player]?
4eka It means: «I'll be yours forever»~

1esb Hey turn around!
1rsa Just kidding .. I'm just kidding ...
